# Password Generator
In this project, JavaScript was implemented to generate a random password according to the criteria determined by the user.
## Project Description.
This simple application is composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The HTML and CSS files provide the structure and styling of the page while the JavaScript supplies functionality for the password generating program. How the application opperates:
- The user is first asked if they want to "Generate Password". After clicking the button, the user is further asked for a set of criteria for the password to fulfill.
- The user must select the desired length, between 8 and 128 characters. If the value is less or higher than that range, then the user is redirected back to select a correct value.
- The user then chooses whether the password will include lowercase, uppercase, special and/or numeric characters. Once selected, the program will generate a random password according to the criteria set by the user.
